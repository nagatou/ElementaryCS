dear my friend watanabe.  I was afraid that you were engaged. so I am. very much so.  then I can wait in the next room. not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.  the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave A bob of greeting, with A quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes. try the settee, said mishima, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. I know, my dear watanabe, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.  but then use your grey brain cell. oops, isnt these somewhat strange statment?  might have mixed up two famous detectives.  can you see?  anyway, good luck for your study and your future!!
