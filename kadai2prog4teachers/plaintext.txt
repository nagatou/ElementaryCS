We propose a model-checking approach for analyzing the robustness of procedures that suffer from human-made faults.  Many procedures executed by humans incorporate fault detection and recovery tasks to recover from human-made faults.  Examining whether such recovery tasks work as expected is crucial for preserving the trust and reliability inherent in safety-critical domains.  To achieve this, we used a type of fault-injection method that injects a set of human-made faults into a fault-free model of a given procedure; the fault set is selected according to Swain's discrete action classification.  We use a model checker to determine paths to error states within the model and its properties formalized via CCS and LTL.
